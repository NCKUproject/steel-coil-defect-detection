# Steel Coil Defect Detection
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system for detecting surface defects on steel coils.
Using deep learning and computer vision techniques, the system identifies various defects such as scratches, dents, and stains from high-resolution industrial images.
It aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of quality inspection in steel manufacturing lines.
